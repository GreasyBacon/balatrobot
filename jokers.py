# Scoring Rules for Balatro
## ð¢ Basic Formula

The total score of a hand is calculated using the formula:

**Score = Chips Ã Multiplier**

This value is computed through four main stages, in the following order:

### 1. Base Hand Chip/Multiplier
- Determined by your poker hand type (e.g., Pair, Straight, Full House) and its level (upgraded via Planet cards).
- This stage adds base chips and base mult based on the hand type and level.
- Certain jokers (e.g., Space Joker) or boss effects (e.g., The Arm, The Flint) can modify hand level or base values.
- Hand type recognition can be modified by jokers like Four Fingers, Shortcut, and Smeared Joker.
- Order of cards does not affect hand recognition.

### 2. Played Cardsâ Scoring
- Only scored cards (those contributing to the hand type) add chip value and trigger enhancements/effects.
- Cards are evaluated left to right, and order can influence outcomes when involving:
    - Mult-on-score effects (from jokers or âMultâ enhancement)
    - Glass cards (double next multiplier)
    - Certain jokers (e.g., Bloodstone)
- Jokers like Splash allow all played cards to be scored.
- Cards can be debuffed (e.g., by âThe Verdantâ) and thus wonât trigger effects or give chips.

### 3. Held-in-Hand Effects
- Applies to cards in your hand, scored or not.
- Effects include:
    - Steel-enhanced cards (Ã1.5 mult)
    - Baron joker (mult from Kings)
    - Shoot the Moon (mult from Queens)
    - Reserved Parking ($ chance from face cards)
    - Raised Fist (mult from lowest-ranked card)
- Red Seals trigger these effects twice.
- âThe Hookâ discards your hand before evaluation, disabling held effects.
- Debuffed cards do not trigger held effects.

### 4. Joker Effects
- Evaluated left to right.
- Jokers give +chips, +mult, or Ãmult, based on their conditions.
- Effects can be modified by Joker enhancements:
    - Foil: +50 chips
    - Holographic: +10 mult
    - Polychrome: Ã1.5 mult
- Order matters when:
    - Using Blueprint/Brainstorm
    - Combining +mult and Ãmult jokers (always put Ãmult to the right for maximum effect)
- Upgradeable jokers trigger upgrades before giving effect.
- Degrading jokers (e.g., Ice Cream) apply effect before degrading.

shop_strategy = """
## Key Strategies for the Shop
*Prioritize Synergy*: Look for Jokers that work well together. For example, a Joker that boosts chips based on discards is excellent for a discard-heavy build. A Joker that boosts multipliers based on hand type is great if you're focusing on a specific hand like straights or flushes.
*Balance Jokers*: Aim for a mix of Jokers that provide chip boosts, multiplier boosts, and multiplier scaling (xMult). A deck with only one type of Joker can be less effective in the long run.
*Consider Hand Types*: Choose a hand type (e.g., flush, full house) and build your deck around it. This allows for more focused strategy and easier scaling with Planet and Tarot cards.
*Don't Overlook Vouchers*: Vouchers provide permanent upgrades, so keep an eye out for them in the shop after defeating bosses. Some vouchers offer significant discounts, so plan your purchases accordingly.
*Be Mindful of Blinds*: Check the upcoming blinds, especially boss blinds, to anticipate their abilities and adjust your deck accordingly.
*Reroll Strategically*: Don't be afraid to reroll the shop, especially if you have a good amount of gold and a specific Joker in mind. Rerolls become more expensive with each use, but reset after each round.
*Utilize Tarot Cards*: Tarot cards can be powerful tools for deck manipulation, allowing you to add, remove, or modify cards. They can be crucial for tailoring your deck to your chosen strategy.
*Consider Skipping Blinds*: If you can afford to skip a blind, you can potentially save money for the next shop visit and earn more interest on your gold, which can be used for future upgrades.
*Economy Matters*: Keep an eye on your gold and try to maximize interest by saving. This will allow you to purchase more upgrades in the shop.
